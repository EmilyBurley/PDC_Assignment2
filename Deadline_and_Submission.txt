Due: March 10 by 11:00 PM.

This is an individual assignment, i.e., it should not be completed in
a group.

Complete all the exercises from Section 2.

Take screenshots of any outputs.

Put any screenshots and all your programs as a single PDF file.
Upload the PDF file in Moodle. You are not required to upload program
files separately.

Please make sure to format the programs so that they can be easily
